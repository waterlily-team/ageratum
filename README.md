### WLAssets

A small, incredibly specialized [asset library]() for handling things like [tilesets](), generic images (`JPEG`, `PNG`, `BMP`), music, etcetera. It's built to be performant but incredibly simple, and has but a single file, which acts duly as a header and implementation file. WLAssets depends on nothing but the [C standard library]().

#### Support
WLAssets current supports the following [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) and [processor architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture).

- [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux): Currently supported. Tested on [`arch`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux).
    - [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64): Currently supported. Tested on an [`AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 5600H`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_Ryzen_processors#Desktop_processors).
    - [ARM64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64): **Not yet supported, but planned.**
- [MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS): **Not yet supported, but planned.**
    - [Apple Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon): **Not yet supported, but planned.**
- [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution): **Not yet supported, but planned.**
    - [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64): **Not yet supported, but planned.**
    - [ARM64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64): **Not yet supported, but planned.**

WLAssets does not plan to support [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), for it is truly development hell in regards to C.

WLAssets supports the following formats of media, alongside "unknown" files which are treated as raw bytes.

- Generic:
    - [EXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable): **Not yet supported, but planned.**

- Audio:
    - [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3): **Not yet supported, but planned.**

#### Usage
You can use WLAssets by including the main header file in any file in your project. However, in **one** of these files, define the `WLASSETS_IMPLEMENTATION` macro to add the implementation as well. An example would be as follows;

```c
#define WLASSETS_IMPLEMENTATION
#include <WLAssets.h>

int main(void) {
    // Do your stuff.
}
```
